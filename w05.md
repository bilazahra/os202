# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [fcntl.h](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_system_calls/fcntl.htm)<br>
fcntl is a manipulate file descriptor.
fcntl performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor fd. 
The operation is determined by cmd.

2. [stdio.h](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/header-files-stdio-h-and-stdlib-h-in-c#:~:text=The%20header%20file%20stdio.,of%20the%20functions%20in%20stdio.)<br>
The stdio.h header defines three variable types, several macros, and various functions for performing input and output.
There are function printf(), remove(), etc.

3. [string.h](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/string_h.htm)<br>
string.h is the header in the C standard library for the C programming language which contains macro definitions, constants and declarations of functions and types used not only for string handling but also various memory handling functions.
Functions declared in string.h are extremely popular, since as a part of the C standard library, they are guaranteed to work on any platform which supports C.

4. [mman.h](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man7/sys_mman.h.7posix.html)<br>
sys/mman.h is a memory management declarations.
It is a method of memory-mapped file I/O. 
It implements demand paging, because file contents are not read from disk directly and initially do not use physical RAM at all. 

5. [stat.h](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/sys/stat.h.html)<br>
stat.h is a Unix system call that returns file attributes about an inode. 
The semantics of stat.h vary between operating systems.

6. [types.h](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/filesreference/types.h.html)<br>
types.h defines data types used in system source code. 
Since some system data types are accessible to user code, they can be used to enhance portability across different machines and operating systems. 

7. [unistd.h](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-header-file-unistd-h-used-for)<br>
unistd.h is the name of the header file that provides access to the POSIX operating system API.


8. [uchar.h](http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0_sp1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.qnx.doc.dinkum_en_c99%2Fuchar.html)<br>
The uchar.h file declares unsigned integer type used for 16-bit and 32-bit characters.
The uchar.h file also lists the prototype declarations for the following Unicode utility functions: mbrtoc16(), mbrtoc32(), c16rtomb(), and c32rtomb().

9. [trace.h](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/filesreference/trace.h.html)<br>
trace.h defines implementation trace that IEEE POSIX 1003 identifies.
The trace.h header defines the posix_trace_event_info structure.

10. [values.h](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/ssw_aix_71/filesreference/values.h.html)<br>
The values.h file contains a set of constants that are conditionally defined for particular processor architectures. 
The model for integers is assumed to be a ones or twos complement binary representation, in which the sign is represented by the value of the high-order bit.
