# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Scripting Language](https://www.dummies.com/programming/macintosh/what-is-scripting-anyway/)<br>
A scripting language is used to write scripts.
These contain a series of commands that are interpreted one by one at runtime unlike programming languages that are compiled first before running.
Scripting languages can be divided into two categories, server side scripting languages and client side scripting languages.

2. [Difference between Scripting and Programming Language](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2018/12/08/difference-between-a-programming-language-and-a-scripting-language/#:~:text=The%20primary%20difference%20between%20a,scripting%20languages%20use%20an%20interpreter.)<br>
Basically, all scripting languagers are programming languages.
The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted.

3. [Difference between server-side scripting and client-side scripting](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-server-side-scripting-and-client-side-scripting.html#:~:text=The%20main%20difference%20between%20server,involves%20server%20for%20its%20processing.&text=The%20client-side%20script%20executes,end%20which%20users%20cannot%20see.)<br>
The only significant difference between the two is that the former requires a server for its processing.
The server-side scripting usually happens on the back-end of a website.
Client-side scripting can be defined as a code that is visible among the users.

4. [Bash](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash)<br>
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.
Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions.
Bash can also read and execute commands from a file called a shell script.

5. [Regex](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/regex.html)<br>
A regular expression is a special text string for describing a search pattern. 
A regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage the text.
In javascript, regex are also objects.

6. [Sed](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/)<br>
Sed is a stream editor.
A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
Sed works by making only one pass over the input(s) and is consequently more efficient.

7. [AWK](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/awk-command-unixlinux-examples/)<br>
AWK is a programming language and a POSIX specification that originated at AT&T Bell Laboratories in 1977.
It's often used to process raw text files, interpreting the data it finds as records and fields to be manipulated by the user.
At its most basic, AWK searches files for some unit of text (usually lines terminated with an end-of-line character) containing some user-specified pattern.

8. [Application Programming Interface](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/)<br>
API is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries.
It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc.
It can also provide extension meshanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.

9. [Clustered System](https://www.etegro.com/cluster-systems/)<br>
Clustered Systems or also known as computer clusters refers to a group or cluster of computers working together.
This can be considered as a single system.
The computer cluster can be lightly or loosely connected.
Basically, they have independent computer systems with a common storage and the systems work together.

10. [File Systems](https://www.ufsexplorer.com/articles/file-systems-basics.php)<br>
File system is a process that manages how and where data on a storage disk, typically a hard disk drive is stored, accessed and managed.
It is a logical disk component that manages a disk's internal operations as it relates to a computer and is abstract to a human user.
A file system provides a way of separating the data on the drive into individual pieces, which are the files.
