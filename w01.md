# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)#:~:text=Android%20is%20a%20mobile%20operating,such%20as%20smartphones%20and%20tablets.&text=Some%20well%20known%20derivatives%20include,wearables%2C%20both%20developed%20by%20Google.)<br>
Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google. 
It is used by several smartphones and tablets. 
The Android operating system (OS) is based on the Linux kernel.
Android phones typically come with several built-in applications and also support third-party programs. 
Developers can create programs for Android using the free Android software developer kit (SDK).

2. [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)<br>
iOS is a mobile operating system created and developed by Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. 
It is the operating system that powers many of the company's mobile devices, including the iPhone.
It also powered the iPad until the introduction of iPadOS, a derivative of iOS, in 2019. 
It is the world's second-most widely installed mobile operating system, after Android.

3. [Linux](https://opensource.com/resources/linux)<br>
Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. 
As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

4. [System Program](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-programs-in-operating-system/)<br>
System Programming can be defined as act of building Systems Software using System Programming Languages.
System programs provide an environment where programs can be developed and executed. 
In the simplest sense, system programs also provide a bridge between the user interface and system calls. 
In reality, they are much more complex. 
For example, a compiler is a complex system program.

5. [Application Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software)<br>
An application software is a comprehensive, self-contained program that performs a particular function directly for the user. 
Among many others, application software include Email, web browsers, gaming software, word processors, graphics software, media player etc.
All of these programs provide an application to the end users, so they are known as application programs.

6. [Double Data Rate](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/understanding-ddr-sdram-faq/)<br>
It is an advanced version of SDRAM, a type of computer memory. DDR-SDRAM, sometimes called "SDRAM II," can transfer data twice as fast as regular SDRAM chips. 
This is because DDR memory can send and receive signals twice per clock cycle. 
The efficient operation of DDR-SDRAM makes the memory great for notebook computers since it uses up less power.

7. [DDR, DDR-2, DDR-3](https://www.hardwaresecrets.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ddr-ddr2-and-ddr3-memories/)<br>
In number 6 we already talking about DDR, and this is the different between DDR, DDR-2, DDR-3!

8. [Binary Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)<br>
Binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).

9. [Hexadecimal Number](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/binary/bin_3.html)<br>
The hexadecimal numeral system, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). 
The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 
Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols. 
There are no numerical symbols that represent values greater than nine, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically A, B, C, D, E and F. 
Hexadecimal A = decimal 10, and hexadecimal F = decimal 15.

10. [Decimal Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal)<br>
The decimal numeral system (also called base-ten positional numeral system, and occasionally called denary or decanary) is the standard system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers. 
It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system.
The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as decimal notation.
