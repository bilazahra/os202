# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Shared Library in Linux](https://datacadamia.com/os/linux/so)<br>
Shared Libraries are the libraries that can be linked to any program at run-time. 
They provide a means to use code that can be loaded anywhere in the memory.
Shared libraries provide modularity to the development environment as the library code can be changed, modified and recompiled without having to re-compile the applications that use this library.

2. [Data Type - Pointer](https://datacadamia.com/code/type/pointer)<br>
A pointer is the address location at which a value is stored.
The pointer is a value that refers directly to (or points to) another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address.
A pointer value is the address of a variable. 
Not every value has an address, but every variable does.

3. [Loader](https://datacadamia.com/os/loader)<br>
Loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries. 
It is one of the essential stages in the process of starting a program, as it places programs into memory and prepares them for execution. 
Loading a program involves reading the contents of the executable file containing the program instructions into memory, and then carrying out other required preparatory tasks to prepare the executable for running. 
Once loading is complete, the operating system starts the program by passing control to the loaded program code.

4. [Boot Loader](https://datacadamia.com/os/boot_loader)<br>
A bootloader, also known as a boot program or bootstrap loader, is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. 
For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a bootloader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. 
The boot medium receives information from the computers firmware (e.g. BIOS) about where the bootloader is. 
The whole process is also described as booting.

5. [Object File](https://datacadamia.com/os/object_file)<br>
An object file is a computer file containing object code, that is, machine code output of an assembler or compiler. 
The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable. 
There are various formats for object files, and the same machine code can be packaged in different object file formats. 
An object file may also work like a shared library.

6. [Executable File / Program](https://datacadamia.com/os/elf)<br>
An executable file is a file that is used to perform various functions or operations on a computer. 
Unlike a data file, an executable file cannot be read because it's compiled. 
On an IBM compatible computer, common executable files are .BAT, .COM, .EXE, and .BIN.
Depending on the operating system and its setup, there can also be other executable files.

7. [PATH](https://datacadamia.com/os/path)<br>
PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. 
In general, each executing process or user session has its own PATH setting.

8. [FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code. 
This is achieved by running file system code in user space while the FUSE module provides only a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces.

9. [File Transfer - Wget](https://datacadamia.com/network/transfer/wget)<br>
Wget is an online control tool intended to transfer files via the HTTP, HTTPS et FTP protocols.

10. [Rsync](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-rsync-for-local-and-remote-data-transfer-and-synchronization/)<br>
Rsync is a fast and versatile command-line utility for synchronizing files and directories between two locations over a remote shell, or from/to a remote Rsync daemon. 
It provides fast incremental file transfer by transferring only the differences between the source and the destination.
Rsync can be used for mirroring data, incremental backups, copying files between systems, and as a replacement for scp , sftp , and cp commands.
