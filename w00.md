# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [Operating System](https://techterms.com/definition/operating_system)<br>
An operating system is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer.
An operating system is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. 
Since the operating system serves as a computer's fundamental user interface, it significantly affects how you interact with the device.

2. [Block Diagram](https://www.edrawmax.com/block-diagram/)<br>
A block diagram is a diagram of a system in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks.
They are heavily used in engineering in hardware design, electronic design, software design, and process flow diagrams.
Block Diagram is a fundamental way that hardware and software developers utilize to describe these systems while illustrating their workflows and processes.

3. [Software License](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/5-types-of-software-licenses-you-need-to-understand/)<br>
A software license is a legal instrument (usually by way of contract law, with or without printed material) governing the use or redistribution of software.
Authors of copyrighted software can donate their software to the public domain, in which case it is also not covered by copyright and, as a result, cannot be licensed.
There are 5 types of software licenses you need to understand!

4. [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)<br>
Free software means software that respects users freedom and community.
The Free Software Definition written by Richard Stallman and published by Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as being software that ensures that the end users have freedom in using, studying, sharing and modifying that software.
A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms.
The freedom to run the program means the freedom for any kind of person or organization to use it on any kind of computer system, for any kind of overall job and purpose, without being required to communicate about it with the developer or any other specific entity.

5. [Open-Source Software](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)<br>
Open-source software (OSS) is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose.
Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. 
Open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration.

6. [Windows](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/windows.htm)<br>
Windows is a series of operating systems developed by Microsoft. 
Each version of Windows includes a graphical user interface, with a desktop that allows users to view files and folders in windows. 
For the past two decades, Windows has been the most widely used operating system for personal computers PCs.

7. [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/what-is/)<br>
This is the operating system that runs on Macintosh computers. 
It is pronounced, "mack-oh-es." 
The Mac OS has been around since the first Macintosh was introduced in 1984. 
Since then, it has been continually updated and many new features have been added to it.

8. [Copyleft Software](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/#:~:text=Copyleft%20is%20a%20general%20method,in%20the%20public%20domain%2C%20uncopyrighted.)<br>
Copyleft is a method for making a software program free, while requiring that all modified and extended versions of the program also be free, and released under the same terms and conditions.
When an open source software project is published with a copyleft license, other developers have the right to use, modify, and share the work as long as the reciprocity obligation is maintained.

9. [C Standard Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9)<br>
C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the Unix operating system. 
C is the most widely used computer language, that keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers. 
The C Standard Library is a set of C built-in functions, constants and header files like <stdio.h>, <stdlib.h>, <math.h>, etc. 
This library will work as a reference manual for C programmers.

10. [Virtual Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory".
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of main memory. 
The addresses a program may use to reference memory are distinguished from the addresses the memory system uses to identify physical storage sites, and program generated addresses are translated automatically to the corresponding machine addresses.
